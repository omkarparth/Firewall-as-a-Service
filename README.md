# Firewall-as-a-Service

Designed and developed a customized Firewall as a Cloud service from scratch for multiple tenants with the use of NC State's VCL (Virtual Computing Lab). 

Developed an automated VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) solution in Python, Bash and Ansible which will spawn a VPC including public gateways, internal gateways, and computing instances, as per the input given by the customer.

Designed a customized cloud service architecture across multi-hypervisors to support multiple tenants using Virtualization  and SDN technologies including VLANs, Port Forwarding, Overlay Networks, and so on.

Automated deployment of firewall policies on the desired location (gateways/network based firewall OR computing instances/host based firewall) using Iptables, Ansible and Python based on the policies inputted by the customer.

Extensive usage of Docker containers, Python, Ansible, Bash, libvirt-apis, Iptables, VxLAN, GRE, QEMU, KVM, and other Overlay & Virtualization technologies.
